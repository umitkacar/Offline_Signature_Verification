# Offline_Signature_Verification
Convolutional Siamese Network

Determination of the Precision-Recall point:
- It is an important case to determine that the signature is false in the banking sector.
- Therefore, keeping the "Recall" value high is a priority.
- However, the "Precision" value should be in a range that prevents the customer from signing again and again.

# APPENDIX
- ROC Curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for a predictive model using different probability thresholds.
- Precision-Recall curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the positive predictive value for a predictive model using different probability thresholds.
- ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class 
- Precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets.
